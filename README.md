# domain_exporter

Exports the expiration time of your domains as prometheus metrics.

#### Environment variables

- `DOMAIN_EXPORTER_URL_PREFIX` â€” use when HTTP endpoint served with a prefix,
  e.g.: For this endpoint `http://example.org/exporters/domains` set to
  `/exporters/domains`. Not really required since useful only to prevent
  breaking human-oriented links. Defaults to empty string.

## Configuration

On the Prometheus settings, add the `domain_exporter` probe:

```yaml
- job_name: domain
  metrics_path: /probe
  relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__address__]
      target_label: __param_target
    - target_label: __address__
      replacement: localhost:9222 # domain_exporter address
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - carlosbecker.com
      - carinebecker.com
      - watchub.pw
```

It works more or less like Prometheus's
[blackbox_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).

Alerting rules examples can be found on the
[_examples](https://github.com/caarlos0/domain_exporter/tree/main/_examples)
folder.

You can configure `domain_exporter` to always export metrics for specific
domains. Create configuration file:
```yaml
domains:
- google.com
- reddit.com
```
And pass file path as argument to `domain_exporter`:
```
domain_exporter --config=domains.yaml
```

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

  helm repo add orihomie https://orihomie.github.io/helm-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
orihomie` to see the charts.

To install the chart:

    helm install domain-exporter orihomie/domain-exporter

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete domain-exporter

**manually**:

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page][releases] or clone
the repository build from source.
