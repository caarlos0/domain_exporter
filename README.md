# domain_exporter

Exports the expiration time of your domains as prometheus metrics.

## Running

```console
./domain_exporter -b ":9222"
```

Or with docker:

```console
docker run -p 9222:9222 caarlos0/domain_exporter
```

## Configuration

On the prometheus settings, add the domain_exporter prober:

```yaml
- job_name: domain
  scrape_interval: 2h
  metrics_path: /probe
  relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__address__]
      target_label: __param_target
    - source_labels: [__param_target]
      target_label: domain
    - target_label: __address__
      replacement: localhost:9222 # domain_exporter address
  static_configs:
    - targets:
      - carlosbecker.com
      - carinebecker.com
      - watchub.pw
```

It works more or less like prometheus's
[blackbox_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).

Alerting rules examples can be found on the
[_examples](https://github.com/caarlos0/domain_exporter/tree/master/_examples)
folder.
